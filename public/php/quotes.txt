Bacteria - they only real culture we've got
A mind like a steel trap - rusty and illegal in 37 states
If at first you don't succeed, redefine success
More tense than Jesse Jackson on Father's Day
A fool and his money can throw one hell of a party
What's poppin' baby
A good pun is its own reword
No one listens until we make a mistake
Wondering what the best thing before sliced bread was
Only looking at your nametag, honest
Hard work will pay off later, but laziness pays off now
If it's worth taking seriously it's worth making fun of
Couldn't care less about apathy
Hypochondria - the only disease we don't have
Friction can be a drag sometimes
Holding a seminar on time travel two weeks ago
Tippin' a forty for Wall Street
The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
Not a complete idiot - some parts are missing
Vegetarian because I hate plants
Running out of places to hide the bodies
Not just for breakfast anymore
One bad relationship away from having 30 cats
Does anyone read this stuff
Sex so good even the neighbors had a cigarette
New and Improved
I wondered why the Frisbee was getting bigger, and then it hit me
Some days it's not worth chewing through the straps
A clean desk is a sign of a cluttered drawer
So old we shop at EXTREMELY Old Navy
Some days the pigeon, some days the statue
If it ain't broke, fix it till it is
Taking something to help our kleptomania
Wondering why kamikaze pilots wore helmets
Leaving messages before the beep
If not for the last minute, nothing would get done
So blonde it takes us two hours to watch 60 minutes
I studied for a blood test and failed
If you’re like me, and I know I am...
A few clowns short of a circus
One Fruit Loop shy of a full bowl
One taco short of a combination plate
An intellect rivaled only by garden tools
Wondering why phonetic isn't spelled how it sounds
Wondering why drive-up ATMs have braille
Rehab is for quitters
Unique like everyone else
VENI, VEDI, VISA
As I said before, I'm not repeating myself
Nostalgia isn't what it used to be
Saving the whales - collecting the whole set
Nothing is foolproof to a talented fool
Two wrongs are only the beginning
If you think nobody cares, try missing a couple of payments
Ambivalent? Well, yes and no
Girls are like pianos. When they're not upright, they're grand
Always there when we need you
Committees keep minutes and waste hours
Wondering if illiterate people get the full effect of alphabet soup
Copywight Elmer Fudd - All Wights Wesewved
Loving deadlines, and the whooshing sound as they fly by
When rats leave a sinking ship, where exactly do they think they're going?
