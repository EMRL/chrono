Subject: Gmail is different. Here's what you need to know.

Didn't have the patience to wait for Outlook 2013 to sync my Gmail, but
above is a reply to a different message.

First off, welcome. And thanks for agreeing to help us test Gmail. By now
you probably know the key ways in which Gmail differs from traditional
webmail services. Searching instead of filing. A free gigabyte of storage.
